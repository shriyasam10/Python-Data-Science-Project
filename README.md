1.The project includes performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on various datasets(Human Activity dataset,Dow_jones dataset).                     
2.The file Basic_NN contains a neural net built from scracth by making use of Pandas and  numpy alone.

3.The Basic_Keras file demonstrates the usage of keras on the MNIST Dataset(fashion).The model  predicts the type of clothing for the  given input image.By training the model for 5  epochs we are able to achieve Accuracy of 86%.
